    <h1>SEBASTIAN</h1>
    <h2>I have learned a lot about my level of tolerance for coding. It's hard for me to continously code within an hour. There is so much to not only memorize but to understand. There were times where I could do nothing but stare at my computer, hoping that I would figure what to do. Despite all the obstacles I encountered, I enjoyed to coding over the course of this year. I had fun learning diferent types of programming languages and training myself to comprehend various lines of code. I'm not sure if I'll pursue a career in computer science, but I hope to one day work as some type of engineer.</h2>
